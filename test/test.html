				<h3 class="page-subheading">Our company</h3>
				<p>We build <span>Sustainable One Health Communities</span> (SOHCs), each comprising five primary components:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>A Co-operative Society of Ubricans (CSU) constituted by our members drawing from local communities in 7,250 villages in Kenya.</li>
				<li>Produce/product workshops for improving quality and packaging of things produced by our members.</li>
				<li>A retail store that serves as a market for produce and products by members of the CSU.</li>
				<li>A one-health clinic that provides clinical services to members of the CSU.</li>
				<li>A web/mobile platform for managing the commerce issuing from the retail system.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>

				<div class="cms-box">The retail store, the one health clinic, the co-operative workshop and the mobile application comprises the Ubrica Retail Clinical Center (URCC), that activates the 4th element of health production.
				<p style="text-align: left;">We have designed SOHCs to overcome grand challenges in global health. We recognize the critical role of animals, environment, and economy in human health.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">We believe that sustainable health production in global health is a function of a system that integrates simultaneous operation of these four elements of human health, animal health, environmental health and economic health.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Our SOHCs are rooted in the conception that economic development is the most powerful means of health production. Economic development is the greatest cause of improvement in health.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Economic health, the 4th element of health production, is the primary driver of sustainable one-health in any community in the world.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">It is common knowledge that compared to a wealthy person a poor person is more likely to get sick; more likely to develop complications of disease; more likely to succumb complications and to develop disability due to disease, and more likely to die from a disease.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">It is impossible to improve health of a poor person in the long term, without improving the wealth of the person in the long term.</p>

				<h1><strong>Soko Janja online market place that will help local people to sell their products, product and services.</strong></h1>
				<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
				<p>The philosophy of Soko Janja is to increase the selling power of people at their basic level of existence. Many people are locked out of traditional market that is highly manipulated by brokers and cartel.</p>
				<p><strong>Vision </strong></p>
				<p>The vision of Soko Janja is to become the leading market place of choice for everyone to trade products, produce and services.</p>
				<p><strong>Mission </strong></p>
				<p>The mission is to bring the village level commerce into the cyber-space, so that everyone in the world, can buy and sell from everyone else in the world.</p>
				<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
				<p>The objective is to begin work in Kenya, enrolling agricultural producers, products manufacturers and service providers (“clients”) into Soko Janja. The goal is to list at least 300,000 clients on the Soko Janja by the end of 2018. We believe that by doing so, we shall create a vibrant market that will eventually reach and enroll 14 million families in Kenya.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><strong>The Big Idea</strong></p>
				<p>We believe that individuals with increased selling power will have increased buying power. Not only will they afford to buy goods to meet their needs, they will also buy health services effectively. We believe that Soko Janja will increase economic status of individuals everywhere in the country. Such individuals, in turn will have money to pay for health financing products, such as health insurance and contributions to the national health insurance fund. Ultimately, Soko Janja will be a health financing project, that will enable us to achieve universal health access in Kenya, by helping local people to make money from their everyday work.</p>
